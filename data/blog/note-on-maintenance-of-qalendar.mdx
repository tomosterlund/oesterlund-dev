Hey friend. Since time is a valuable commodity, I’ll try to keep it short and to the point. First just a small sentiment of mine and a little context to this note. Feel free to skip down to the news on the maintenance status.

## A little context

It has now been almost two years since I wrote the first line of code on Qalendar. To me it has been a journey full of learning, cooperation with cool people, and a ton of fun. I love coding. I love the open source community. Though it is still a fairly small open source project, seeing the calendar be adopted by startups, public institutions and hobby projects all over the world has been a real joy.

As much as I learned while building the calendar, over time I have also come to see the limitations of the way I built it. These limitations then eventually led me to the decision to start from scratch. So in August this year I did. The goal this time was to achieve a few things which Qalendar has not, and probably never will:

- **Framework agnosticism.** I’m aiming to build a great, quality calendar component. And not only for Vue this time.
- **Endless customization.** Qalendar can be customized. But only to some extent. The goal that I envision, is to have the calendar be extensible by a plugin-mechanism.
- **Material design 3.** Qalendar is loosely based on it. In order to really fit seamlessly into other applications using MD, I want the calendar to more strictly adhere to the specification.

The result of my efforts so far is now found here: https://schedule-x.dev/. If you’re not customizing a lot in Qalendar, chances are you could be able to switch to Schedule-X with fairly low effort, if you wish to do so. I would love to see you there. Schedule-X is now the project that I will keep working on and keep enhancing. If you customize a lot of things though, it will probably take a while longer until Schedule-X can offer you everything that Qalendar can.

## Note on maintenance

Qalendar is going nowhere. Its author, however, is. In order to direct more attention to Schedule-X, I will not continue developing features for Qalendar. From this point on, I will:

- Fix bugs when reported via GitHub issues.
- Review pull requests, as long as a feature was agreed upon through an issue on GitHub.
- Keep dependencies up to date.

If you are interested in gaining a maintainer status of the project, in order to not depend on my activity, I would also be willing to:

- Onboard you in the project code and infrastructure.
- Sporadically assist with advice and ideas.
- Give you the maintainer status.

My main expectation on a future maintainer, aside from the ability to code, would be a willingness to communicate and also to exercise caution in regard to breaking changes. If this is of interest to you, feel free to shoot me a message on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/tom-österlund-3752b516a). I’ll be happy to hear from you.

## Thanks

Last of all: it has been a pleasure so far working with so many people to improve the calendar. Looking forward to the time ahead.

Best,

Tom
