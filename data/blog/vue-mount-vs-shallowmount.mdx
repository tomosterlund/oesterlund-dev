## TL;DR

1. If your testing strategy is to write integration style tests; use `mount`. This will test how your components work together. Setup might be more cumbersome, but results more holistic.

2. If your testing strategy is to write unit tests; use `shallowMount`. This helps you test each unit of your application in isolation. Setup might be cheaper, but results more scoped.

## The discussion

I recently took part in a discussion with a bunch of devs, which started with a statement, something along the lines of:

> This test, using shallowMount, is completely redundant. It doesn’t test anything of value.

The developer then showed us a test suite of a component, let’s call it “ProductList”, whose sole purpose was to handle a prop with a list of products, and then render a “Product” component for each product in the list. Mounting this with `shallowMount` might seem trivial at first, as it did for this particular developer. However, I would argue that choosing the right mounting function for you, is completely a matter of testing strategy. Let’s consider the two strategies possible here.

## Writing an integration test with `mount`

For the integration test strategy, we will use `mount`, in order to test our “ProductList” component, but also its integration with its children: a list of “Product” components.

The two components:

```js
// ProductList.vue
<template>
  <Product
      v-for="product in products"
      :product="product"
  />
</template>

<script lang="ts" setup>
import { defineProps, PropType } from 'vue'
import type { ProductType } from "@/types/productType";
import Product from "@/components/product/Product.vue";

defineProps({
  products: {
    type: Array as PropType<ProductType[]>,
    required: true,
  },
})
</script>
```

```js
// Product.vue
<template>
  <div :data-testid="'id-' + product.id">
    <span data-testid="product-title">
      {{ product.title }}
    </span>

    <div
        v-if="product.hasSale"
        data-testid="sale-badge"
    >
      SALE
    </div>

    <div
        data-testid="free-shipping-badge"
        v-if="hasFreeShipping"
    >
      Free shipping
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script lang="ts" setup>
import type { ProductType } from "@/types/productType";
import type { PropType } from "vue";
import { useCustomerStore } from "@/stores/customer";
import { storeToRefs } from "pinia";

defineProps({
  product: {
    type: Object as PropType<ProductType>,
    required: true,
  },
})

const customer = useCustomerStore();
const { hasFreeShipping } = storeToRefs(customer)
</script>
```

First, let’s see what cases we want to test. Considering the code above, I would settle on:

1. Should display a title for all products
2. Should display a “sale” badge
3. Should not display a “sale” badge
4. Should display “free shipping” badges
5. Should not display any “free shipping” badges

And my tests would look like this:

```js
// product-list-integration.spec.ts
import { describe, it, expect, vi } from "vitest";
import { mount } from "@vue/test-utils";
import ProductList from "@/components/product-list/ProductList.vue";
import { createTestingPinia } from '@pinia/testing'
import type { ProductType } from "@/types/productType";
import { useCustomerStore } from "@/stores/customer";

describe("ProductList", () => {
  describe('displaying products', () => {
    const products: ProductType[] = [
      {
        id: 1,
        title: 'Product 1',
        hasSale: false,
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        title: 'Product 2',
        hasSale: true,
      },
    ]

    const mountOptions = {
      props: {
        products,
      },
      global: {
        plugins: [createTestingPinia({
          createSpy: vi.fn
        })],
      }
    }
    const customer = useCustomerStore()

    it('should display a title for both products', () => {
      const wrapper = mount(ProductList, mountOptions)
      const productTitles = wrapper.findAll('[data-testid="product-title"]')

      expect(productTitles).toHaveLength(2)
    })

    it('Should display a "sale" badge', () => {
      const wrapper = mount(ProductList, mountOptions)
      const productWithSale = wrapper.find('[data-testid="id-2"]')

      expect(productWithSale.find('[data-testid="sale-badge"]').exists()).toBe(true)
    })

    it('Should not display a "sale" badge', () => {
      const wrapper = mount(ProductList, mountOptions)
      const productWithoutSale = wrapper.find('[data-testid="id-1"]')

      expect(productWithoutSale.find('[data-testid="sale-badge"]').exists()).toBe(false)
    })

    it('should not display any "free shipping" badges', () => {
      const wrapper = mount(ProductList, mountOptions)

      expect(wrapper.find('[data-testid="free-shipping-badge"]').exists()).toBe(false)
    })

    it('should display "free shipping" badges', () => {
      customer.hasFreeShipping = true
      const wrapper = mount(ProductList, mountOptions)

      expect(wrapper.find('[data-testid="free-shipping-badge"]').exists()).toBe(true)
    })
  })
})
```

Writing tests like this has some implications, positive and negative ones. Let’s start with the positive ones:

1. With a single test suite, we can get test coverage for multiple components.
2. We use an integration of our independent components, much more similar to that how our real application might do it.
3. We can focus more on high level APIs, instead of the individual API of each component.

Drawbacks with this approach:

1. If child components consume a lot of external APIs and data sources, like Pinia modules or calls to a server, setup code for the test suite might become very bloated.
2. The test suite itself might become very large, having to test too many aspects in one place. Consider Yoni Goldberg’s golden rule about tests:

> Design it to be short, dead-simple, flat, and delightful to work with. One should look at a test and get the intent instantly.

## Writing unit tests with `shallowMount`

First of all, notice the plural form: “tests”. If we decide to employ the unit testing strategy, we will not write one test suite anymore, but two. Testing more or less the same 5 cases as in the integration test above, my unit tests would look like this:

```js
// product-list-unit.spec.ts
import { describe, it, expect, vi } from "vitest";
import { shallowMount } from "@vue/test-utils";
import ProductList from "@/components/product-list/ProductList.vue";
import type { ProductType } from "@/types/productType";
import Product from "@/components/product/Product.vue";

describe("ProductList", () => {
  describe('displaying products', () => {
    const products: ProductType[] = [
      {
        id: 1,
        title: 'Product 1',
        hasSale: false,
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        title: 'Product 2',
        hasSale: true,
      },
    ]

    const mountOptions = {
      props: {
        products,
      },
    }

    it('should display 2 products', () => {
      const wrapper = shallowMount(ProductList, mountOptions)
      const products = wrapper.findAllComponents(Product)

      expect(products).toHaveLength(2)
    })
  })
})
```

```js
// product-unit.spec.ts
import { describe, expect, it, vi } from "vitest";
import type { ProductType } from "@/types/productType";
import { shallowMount } from "@vue/test-utils";
import Product from "@/components/product/Product.vue";
import { createTestingPinia } from "@pinia/testing";
import { useCustomerStore } from "@/stores/customer";

describe("Product", () => {
  describe('displaying a product', () => {
    const productWithSale: ProductType = {
      id: 1,
      title: 'Product 1',
      hasSale: true,
    }

    const productWithoutSale: ProductType = {
      id: 2,
      title: 'Product 2',
      hasSale: false,
    }

    const globalOptions = {
      plugins: [
          createTestingPinia({
            createSpy: vi.fn
          })
      ]
    }
    const getProductOnSale = () => {
      return shallowMount(Product, {
        props: {
          product: productWithSale,
        },
        global: globalOptions
      })
    }

    const getProductWithoutSale = () => {
      return shallowMount(Product, {
        props: {
          product: productWithoutSale,
        },
        global: globalOptions
      })
    }

    const customer = useCustomerStore()

    it('should display the product title', () => {
      const wrapper = getProductOnSale()

      const productName = wrapper.find('[data-testid="product-title"]')
      expect(productName.text()).toBe(productWithSale.title)
    })

    it('should display a sale badge', () => {
      const wrapper = getProductOnSale()

      const saleBadge = wrapper.find('[data-testid="sale-badge"]')
      expect(saleBadge.exists()).toBe(true)
    })

    it('should not display a sale badge', () => {
      const wrapper = getProductWithoutSale()

      const saleBadge = wrapper.find('[data-testid="sale-badge"]')
      expect(saleBadge.exists()).toBe(false)
    })

    it('should not display a free shipping badge', () => {
      const wrapper = getProductOnSale()

      const freeShippingBadge = wrapper.find('[data-testid="free-shipping-badge"]')
      expect(freeShippingBadge.exists()).toBe(false)
    })

    it('should display a free shipping badge', () => {
      customer.hasFreeShipping = true
      const wrapper = getProductOnSale()

      const freeShippingBadge = wrapper.find('[data-testid="free-shipping-badge"]')
      expect(freeShippingBadge.exists()).toBe(true)
    })
  })
})
```

So what are the implications of this strategy? First, again, the positive aspects:

1. We can break testing of our system down to smaller chunks. One suite can focus on the APIs of a single component; a unit. Complexity per test might be smaller this way.
2. We take a more fine granular approach to testing, and might therefore discover more edge cases that need testing.
3. Setup code per test becomes less cumbersome. Notice how in the “ProductList” test, we don’t need to worry about the external APIs, like Pinia, of its child components.

On the other hand, this strategy also has its drawbacks:

1. Since all of our components are tested in isolation, we might get a good coverage of all of our individual component APIs. How the components work together, however, is not really tested; all integrations are stubbed and mocked away.
2. Our tests might become more sensitive to refactoring, if we’re not careful. Consider the refactoring costs, of having to refactor 5 unit tests when a Pinia module that they depend on changes, instead of refactoring one test that implicitly tests 4 child components.

## Some end notes

The mounting function you settle with, is a matter of testing strategy. While many prefer using `mount`, arguing that this is more “authentic”, you might have good reasons to think twice.

So what’s my preference?

If I possess the option to invest a lot of resources in automated testing, writing end-to-end tests with for example Cypress or Playwright, I prefer testing components with `shallowMount`. The integration of components is also implicitly tested in my E2E tests. When testing my Vue components, I’ll stick to testing each component and its APIs individually.

On the other hand, if the time you can invest in testing is more scarce, this might be a good reason to try and test the larger picture using `mount`, and instead leave out some E2E tests, which tend to be more expensive.
