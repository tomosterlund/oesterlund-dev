Originally a teacher by profession, I have been building software since 2020.
Taking great joy in the act itself of writing code, it has become a hobby,
guilty pleasure, and sometimes self-imposed responsibility to build open
source. Since spring 2022 I'm building and maintaining the calendar
project [Qalendar](https://github.com/tomosterlund/qalendar).

Currently, I'm employed as a software developer at the German media
company ProSiebenSat.1.
